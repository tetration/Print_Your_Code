When I try to compile your program by typing "python PrintYourCode.py" I´m getting an error message. Your Code is broken!

Most likely your are trying to run the wrong version of my source code. Please if your OS is running Python 2 only use the python2 version located at src_python2 or if you´re running Python 3 use the version located at src_python3. Dont try to compile the python2 version with python 3 or the python3 version in python 2 otherwise you will get an error message.!
